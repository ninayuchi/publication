		<p>Nina began the semester with a question—<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">who was the tallest human alive?</span> <br><br> She found the answer: Robert Pershing Wadlow, who graced the world from 1918–1940 and reached the height of 8’11” (2.72m).  His continued growth until his death was the result of hyperplasia of his pituitary gland, causing abnormally high levels of his growth hormones. <br><br>During his life, Wadlow joined the Ringling Brothers’ Circus and modelled shoes for the International Show Company. <br><br>Though objectified by the public for his height, Wadlow never felt wronged.</p>
